        <h1>Long Rocket March 5B</h1>
        <h2>History and main companies</h2>
        <li>Ancient records show several occasions when people and mathematicians created and used "rockets" for events, research, etc. An example is from the year 1232, in China, where gunpowder was invented, used at first in fireworks as entertainment.
        </li>
        <li>The creation of modern rockets for military power and for space exploration is mainly due to three men, considered the main "fathers" of rockets. One of them was the Russian Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky, who created a complex equation for the rocket to reach space. Another was Robert Goddard, an American physicist who launched the first rocket powered by liquid fuel, in 1926, which traveled 56 meters before falling. The third was the German Hermann Oberth, who studied multistage rockets and his studies inspired the creation of the V-2 rocket, made by Wernher Von Braun, which was used in attacks by Germany during World War II, also being the first to reach the Karman line.
        </li>
        <li>
            After the Second World War, when there were political tensions between the UESS and the USA, the rocket called R-7 was launched, which became the first to place an object in Earth orbit - the Soviet satellite Sputnik-1, in 1957. the beginning of the Space Race between these superpowers, on April 12, 1961, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin flew from a Vostok-K rocket beyond the atmosphere, becoming the first human being to go into space. The United States paved the way for the end of the conflict when they took the first astronauts to the lunar surface, in 1969, with the Apollo-11 mission, which was carried out by the Saturn V rocket, the most famous of the North American space agency. With its 110m height and three stages, this is the most powerful rocket ever used.
        </li>
        <li>SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, ended up revolutionizing the aerospace industry by creating the Falcon 9 reusable rocket. In other words: the rocket is not completely lost after a launch, since its boosters are capable of landing back on the ground to be retrieved and reused in new releases. This means that, with the innovation of SpaceX, space launches have become much more accessible, both for sending cargo and people, and falcon 9 has already made many launches into orbit and intends on various other types of projects, such as landing in Mars, which can cause more than one revolution in the space market.

        </li>
        <h2>Purpose of rockets and usefulness to society
        </h2>
        <p>Rockets are of great importance for space exploration, astronomical research, telecommunications and also for the development of new navigation and propulsion systems, among others.</p>
        <p>Rockets are used to take astronauts and equipment to Earth's orbit or beyond, being able to launch into space instruments such as interplanetary probes, which reveal secrets of distant planets, and satellites with various functions such as predicting the weather (such as hurricanes, cold fronts, dry air mass, among others), detect areas the ozone hole television satellites that send signals from television broadcasts to the receiver in the viewer's home and the satellite monitor enemy movements, track the deployment of weapons and equipment, and even even identify individual targets such as aircraft or vehicles.
        </p>
        <h2>SMART for disclosing the rocket project
        </h2>
        <h3>In person:
        </h3>
        <li>Fairs and events (FEBRACE is a good example);
        </li>
        <li>Dissemination by pamphlets;
        </li>
        <li>Offering promotional gifts;
        </li>
        <li>Disclosure in public transport (bus, train and metro);</li>
        <li>Create a logo for the project and display it in advertisements.
        </li>
        <h3>Digitally:</h3>
        <li>By publications on platforms (Twitter, Instagran, Facebook and others);</li>
        <li>Disclosure with hashtags;</li>
        <li>Disclosure in online communities;</li>
        <li>SEO (Search Engine Optimization);</li>
        <li>Create a logo for the project and display it in advertisements.</li>
        <h2>Rocket project SMART</h2>
        <li>Specific - We have specific and achievable goals. First, we must get the general information, and then the shape, colors and size of the rocket to draw it on a poster with cardboard paper and pens.</li>
        <li>Measurable - It should have criteria for measuring progress and seeing if the goals are realistic and measurable.</li>
        <li>Alchievable - They must understand objectives that are within everyone's reach. To buy and use the necessary resources for the goals, it is possible, if it is economical or if we can already reuse materials already available. All project members have sufficient human resources and capacity to design and assemble the model of this rocket.
        </li>
        <li>Relevant - Relevance and importance must be given to the objective set in order to be fully related to the motivation to achieve it.</li>
        <li>Time Based - Define a schedule with a forecast date for each of the tasks in the action plan.</li>
        <h2>Model and structure - Long March 5B</h2>
        <li>Going up and down, the first part of the rocket is called the tip.</li>
        <li>Then we have the stage that contains the central module (spaceship). It has 25 tons in low orbit.</li>
        <li>Below the main stage, speed of more than 28,000 km/h, 31 meters and weight of 21 tons.</li>
        <li>Below are the auxiliary engines or thrusters, released after take-off.</li>
        <li>The entire rocket is 53.7 meters.
        </li>
